# Write a function called make_album() that builds a dictionary
# describing a music album. The function should take in an artist
# name and an album title, and it should return a dictionary containing
# these two pieces of information. Use the function to make three
# dictionaries representing different albums. Print each return
# value to show that the dictionaries are storing the album information
# correctly.
# Use None to add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows
# you to store the number of songs on an album. If the calling line
# includes a value for the number of songs, add that value to the
# album's dictionary. Make at least one new function call that
# includes the number of songs on an album.
