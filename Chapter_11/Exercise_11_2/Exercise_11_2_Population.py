# Modify your function so it requires a third parameter, population. It should
# now return a single string of the form City, Country - population xxx, such
# as Santiago, Chile - population 5000000. Run the test again, and make sure
# test_city_country() fails this time.
# Modify the function so the population parameter is optional. Run the test,
# and make sure test_city_country() passes again.
