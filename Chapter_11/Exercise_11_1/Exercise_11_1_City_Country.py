# Write a function that accepts two parameters: a city name and a country name.
# The function should return a single string of the form City, Country, such
# as Santiago, Chile. Store this function in a module called city_functions.py,
# and save this file in a new folder so pytest won't try to run the tests we`ve
# already written.
# Create a file called test_cities.py that tests the function you just wrote.
# Write a function called test_city_country() to verify that calling your
# function with values such as 'santiago' and 'chile' results in the correct
# string. Run the test, and make sure test_city_country() passes.
